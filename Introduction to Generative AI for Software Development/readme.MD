### Pair-coding with an LLM

Notice how I adjusted the prompts slightly for each language, reflecting typical naming and syntax conventions, such as calling it a method in C#. This is an important nuance. There's the impression that prompting like this can do away with developers altogether, but I disagree. It's the domain knowledge of the language, the APIs, and the supporting libraries that make you a better developer and will make you a better prompter. Also, I really think that the domain knowledge of the business problem you're trying to solve will give you better ways of expressing the solution in either prompts or code. So your skills and knowledge are extremely valuable even in the age of prompt generated coding.
