# Generative AI for Software Development

This repository documents my learning from the course **<a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/generative-ai-for-software-development/">Generative AI for Software Development</a>** by Laurence Moroney and deeplearning.ai. This repo contains the following directories and each one contains the pertinent files including README and Jupyter Notebook files: 
 
1. [Introduction to Generative AI for Software Development](#1)

Some introductory points:
- This series of courses is about how to **use** generative AI and not about writing generative AI application
- Generative AI is a coding companion buddy to help us along
- McKinsey study, then a Cisco study estimated something like 35-ish, maybe more, percentage improvements in productivity boost for code generation and various tasks
