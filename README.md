# Generative AI for Software Development

This repository documents my learning from the course **<a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/generative-ai-for-software-development/">Generative AI for Software Development</a>** by Laurence Moroney and deeplearning.ai. This repo contains the following directories and each one contains the pertinent files including README and Jupyter Notebook files: 
 
1. [Introduction to Generative AI for Software Development](#1)

Some introductory points:
- This series of courses is about how to **use** generative AI and not about writing generative AI application
- Generative AI is a coding companion buddy to help us along
- McKinsey study, then a Cisco study estimated something like **35-ish**, maybe more, percentage improvements in productivity boost for code generation and various tasks
- Andrew's opinion: what will happen is people that use AI will replace people that don't. But AI won't replace software developers.
- Shrinking LLMs would be the trend. Laurence Moroney's viewpoint: Absolutely. And I also think that if the word is shrinkification, the fact that LLMs are getting smaller but still being as effective, I really see that trend continuing and increasing and making again the job of a developer that bit easier. So now, instead of outsourcing to a third party via a chatbot or those kind of things with your code, you could have an LLM running on your local machine. That's trained on your code base, that's an expert on your domain that you can then use as that pair programmer alongside you. And I see that being a major trend. And in addition to that, of course, then many companies won't allow their source code to be shared outside. You can't bring it to ChatGPT or cloud or anything like that. But when you have an internal model running on your own development box, that's when, again, I think the floodgates can open on these.
- This analogy of pair programming is great and you always have a buddy with you now that you can ask her a question with from right away.
- If pair programming with AI is not helping solve the immediate problem, it sparks inspiration. Some of the answers that it gives will help me find a different track that I'm going to follow to be able to fix a particular problem or to go a whole new direction that I hadn't previously thought of. And it's that sparking of inspiration is one of the things that really can make the task more enjoyable
